The Buildroot environment can be retrieved from
<https://github.com/linux4sam/buildroot-at>.
Or it can be downloaded from the main site <https://buildroot.org>.

The newer Buildroot 2023.10 was added for updated packages.

# Can use any Buildroot version
cd buildroot-at91-linux4microchip-2023.10

# Point BR2_EXTERNAL to provided source code location
make BR2_EXTERNAL=../ung_apps_external sam9x75_curiosity_defconfig

make

Program the NAND using provided script.  Note the procedure is power down the
board.  Remove the jumper next to the NAND chip.  Power up the board and put
back the jumper.

cd output
./flash.sh

# Test the MMC version
make clean
make sam9x75_curiosity_mmc_defconfig
make

Program the SD card using provided script.  Note the device may need to be
changed to different one depending on computer configuration.
It is recommended to use Etcher to program the card.

../ung_apps_external/sdprog.sh

# Verify the build is successful.  After kernel boots use these commands to
# check the status.
cat /proc/version
cat /proc/interrupts
ethtool -S eth0
ethtool lan1
ethtool lan5

# The regs_bin utility can be used to access switch registers.
regs_bin spi0.0


It is recommendedd to use this build during initial debugging and testing of
the LAN9646 board.  It is simple and uses sysinit for initial script running.
After all hardware issues are addressed a newer and more complete software can
be used to support all features of the SAM9X75 board.

This new code is provided by buildroot-external-microchip.  It uses systemd to
setup the system and acts like a Linux PC, so it takes a long time to boot.

It uses the device tree overlay system so a different device tree can be
loaded in U-Boot.

The build procedure is simply to switch to the buildroot-external-microchip
directory.

make BR2_EXTERNAL=../buildroot-external-microchip \
    sam9x75_curiosity_mmc_defconfig

The NAND flash version is done through sam9x75_curiosity_defconfig.


Note the SAM-BA 3.7 utility does not write to the NAND flash correctly as the
OOB section is empty.  Because of that U-Boot cannot execute the "nand read"
command.  It requires manual writing to correct this problem.  Read the file
sam9x75_nand_setup.txt for instructions.
