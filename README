The Buildroot environment can be retrieved from
https://github.com/linux4sam/buildroot-at91.
Or it can be downloaded from the main site <https://buildroot.org>.

The newer Buildroot 2023.10 was added for updated packages.

Internet is required to download code during initial build.  Afterwards it is
not required unless new packages are added to the build image.

Install System Dependencies. The build is tested on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS. 
The following system build dependenciesare required.

sudo apt-get install subversion build-essential bison flex gettext \
libncurses5-dev texinfo autoconf automake libtool mercurial git-core \
gperf gawk expat curl cvs libexpat-dev bzr unzip bc python-dev \
wget cpio rsync xxd bmap-tools libssl-dev

Get the repo
git clone https://github.com/Microchip-Ethernet/EVB-LAN9646.git

# Can use any Buildroot version
cd EVB-LAN9646/buildroot-at91-linux4microchip-2023.10

# Point BR2_EXTERNAL to provided source code location
make BR2_EXTERNAL=../ung_apps_external sam9x75_curiosity_mmc_defconfig
make

The image file sdcard.img is under the output/images directory.

Program the SD card using provided script.  Note the device may need to be
changed to different one depending on computer configuration.
It is recommended to use Etcher to program the card.

../ung_apps_external/sdprog.sh

# Test the NAND flash version if necessary
make clean
make sam9x75_curiosity_defconfig
make

Program the NAND flash using provided script.  A Micro-USB cable should be
connected to the USB port.  This also provides power to the board.  Note the
procedure is remove the jumper next to the NAND chip, reset the board, and put
back the jumper.

cd output
./flash.sh

There is a problem of using this procedure on the SAM9X75 board.  See at the
end about SAM-BA 3.7 utility.

# Verify the build is successful.  After kernel boots use these commands to
# check the status.
cat /proc/version
cat /proc/interrupts
ethtool -S eth0
ethtool lan1
ethtool lan5

# The regs_bin utility can be used to access switch registers.
regs_bin spi0.0

It is suggested to use above build procedure (make BR2_EXTERNAL=../ung_apps_external 
sam9x75_curiosity_mmc_defconfig) during initial debugging and testing of
the LAN9646 board.  It is simple and uses sysinit for initial script running.

For production use, it is recommanded to use below build procedure. This build 
uses 'buildroot-external-microchip' which is official microchip support for SAM
processor family.

It uses the device tree overlay system so a different device tree can be
loaded in U-Boot.

The build procedure is simply to switch to the buildroot-external-microchip
directory.

make BR2_EXTERNAL=../buildroot-external-microchip \
    sam9x75_curiosity_mmc_defconfig

The NAND flash version is done through sam9x75_curiosity_defconfig.

Note the SAM-BA 3.7 utility does not write to the NAND flash correctly as the
OOB section is empty.  Because of that U-Boot cannot execute the "nand read"
command.  It requires manual writing to correct this problem.  Read the file
sam9x75_nand_setup.txt for instructions.
