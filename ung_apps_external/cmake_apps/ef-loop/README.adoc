# ef-loop

This document explains how to use the ef-loop.

# Usage

```bash
ef-loop --help
options:
--src:            source port
--dst:            destination port
--interval        interval of measurements
--help:           help
```

This application justs forwards the frames between the ports in userspace.
If the dst is not set, than the frames are not forward.

The src is required argument. Represents the port on which calculats the
througput.
The dst is not a required argument. It can be the same port as the src. This
represents the destination port of the received frames.
The interval is by default 1 second.

When the application start, a timer starts and every interval second displays the
number of received frames and total size of the frames and calculates the
throughput.
